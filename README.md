This is my attempt to solve each year [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com),
for now, I'm using haskell, but that might change in the future.

I'm compiling each `dayX.hs` and `dayX_extra.hs` using ghc, as `ghc dayX.hs`, and
hopefully executing that program directly gives the result. In some cases, I was
lazy and I directly calculated myself instead of 'programming' it, but whatever...
