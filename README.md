This is my attempt to solve each year [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com),

#### 2015 & 2016 Edition
For now, I'm using haskell, but that might change in the future.

I'm compiling each `dayX.hs` and `dayX_extra.hs` using ghc, as `ghc dayX.hs`, and
hopefully executing that program directly gives the result. In some cases, I was
lazy and I directly calculated myself instead of 'programming' it, but whatever...

#### 2017 Edition

I asked reddit for suggestions of languages, and I'm still undecided between
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). I also
have considered [Go](https://golang.org) but I don't know why I don't see it
as attractive as the others.

Well... I'll end up using haskell again... as someone said, this things are meant
to be fun, and nothing is better that haskell at this :D


###### Todo
Redo 2017 problem 21, I bruteforced it and the computer was all night running, I want
it to be as fast/efficient as usual


#### 2018 Edition
Haskell again, yay!

#### 2019 Edition
Well, with all the shame of not having finshed the 2018 edition before december,
and starting to do the challenges on the 8th... this year I am not being
as focused as others...
