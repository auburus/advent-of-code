# Advent of Code 2016

This is my attempt to solve this years [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com/2016)
using haskell.

I'm compiling with `ghc day1.hs`, and in some cases the program might not give
the final result, but it was easier to get it from the output instead of making
the program calculate it.
