This is my attempt to solve each year [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com),

#### 2015 & 2016 Edition
For now, I'm using haskell, but that might change in the future.

I'm compiling each `dayX.hs` and `dayX_extra.hs` using ghc, as `ghc dayX.hs`, and
hopefully executing that program directly gives the result. In some cases, I was
lazy and I directly calculated myself instead of 'programming' it, but whatever...

#### 2017 Edition

I asked reddit for suggestions of languages, and I'm still undecided between
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). I also
have considered [Go](https://golang.org) but I don't know why I don't see it
as attractive as the others.

Well... I'll end up using haskell again... as someone said, this things are meant
to be fun, and nothing is better that haskell at this :D
